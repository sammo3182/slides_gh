Have-nots [@NewmanEtAl2015]: Respondents were asked the following question: “Some people think of American society as divided into two groups, the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots,’ while others think it’s incorrect to think of America that way. Do you, yourself, think of America as divided into haves and have-nots, or don’t you think of America that way?

:::

:::{.notes}

Impartial governance: 

- The damage of economic disparities on political equality in democracies has been well documented in the literature [@SchlozmanEtAl2013]. 
- Formal and informal institutions exist in non-democracies to convert economic resources into political influence and favorable treatment. 
- Wealthy Chinese private entrepreneurs form extensive connections with local government officials to gain privileges [@ChenDickson2010]. 

Government Non-responsiveness: 

- Substantial evidence indicates that economic inequality reduces social capital and generates distrust and social conflicts. 
- Class conflict theory suggests that in highly unequal societies, people's perceptions of economic positions on the social ladder are accentuated [@KrausEtAl2013]. 
- Low levels of social capital and accentuated social conflicts make governance difficult as @BaldwinHuber2010 showed that income differences make an agreement over which public goods to provide more difficult, therefore have a negative relationship with public goods provision [@EppJennings2020].

:::{.notes}

Judicial Injustice:

1. greater inequality implies that the well-off have more resources to control the legal apparatus while the poor are more disadvantaged.
1. the advantaged are motivated to attempt such control because of intensified social conflicts. 

Anti-Corruption Inadequacy:

When inequality leads to widespread corruption, citizens doubt governments' intentions and abilities to combat corruption and perceive governments as incompetent to address the problems of the system.

    1. POE and SOE riches: economic insequrity
    2. PGO riches: biger view, education (they won't use it)

:::

## Preliminary conclusions

- Economic inequality [changes]{.red} people's mind of the society and power
- The effects conduct through [daily]{.red} sociopolitical observations and feelings.
- Easier exposure to inequality changes people's policy preferences, conditioned by their relationship with the institution---the [microfoundation]{.red} of the redistribution reformation

::: {.fragment .callout-tip}

## Future work

1. Social comparison on perceived inequality and economic insecurity?
1. What come to people's mind when they are exposed to inequality (and the governments' efforts)?
1. How do governmental behaviors affect the inequality effects?
