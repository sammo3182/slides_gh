## D1~2: Framework

- Opening a new document in Word, or take a blank sheet
- Writing down the "creative" point(s) of the paper
    - A.k.a. the one or two sentences that you want the readers to get after reading the piece
- Writing the outline
    1. Figures and tables
    2. Basic frame
        + Introduction
        + Literature Review
        + Theory
        + Method and Data
        + Analysis and Results
        + Discussion and Conclusion
        + Reference [leaving this to the bibliography manager]{.fragment}

## D3~5: Drafting

## How to write readable sentences

::: {.r-hstack}

![@WilliamsBizup2014](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/ew_elementOfStyle.jpg){fig-align="center" height=600}

:::



## Clarity

- Make main characters subjects.
- Make important actions verbs
    + reduce nominalization of verbs.
- When to use nominalization:
    + As a short subject refers to a previous sentence
    + As a motivation ("the fact that" sb. does sth).
    + As the object of the verb
    + A concept so familiar to your readers

::: {.notes}

+ The nominalization as a short subject refers to a previous sentence (e.g., these arguments, this decision.)
+ The nominalization refers to "the fact that" sb. does sth.
+ A nominalization names what would be the OBJECT of the verb, the "what" or "whom" of the verb.
+ A nominalization refers to a concept so familiar to your readers that to them, it is a virtual character

:::

## Coherence

+ Underline the [first five or six words]{.red} in every sentence, and check if they constitute a relatively [small set]{.red} of related ideas and if they name the most important characters.
+ Use the [topic as the subject]{.red}, and put them at the beginning of the sentences.
+ [Don't vary]{.red} the subjects of the sentences frequently
+ Change a little only when the same words for the same topic were times used in the same positions of sentences.
+ [Don't overuse]{.red} "and, also, moreover, another, and so on", words that simply "Here's one more thing."
+ [Don't use]{.red} "but, however, therefore, or consequently" too frequently.


## Elegence

* Revise long sentence
    + Get to the subject of the main clause quickly
    + Get to the verb and object quickly
    + Avoid sprawls (which, that, who + is/was)
    + Drop "although" with a long clause
    + Drop "since" with a long clause
* Balance
    + with coordination (and, or, nor, but, and yet)
    + without coordination but with similarly structure in each clause.
* Climactic Emphasis: leave heavy words at the end
    + Heavy: n. > a./ad. > prep.

## Wrap up

- Preparation
- D1~2: construct the framework
    - Bullet points
- D3~5: drafting
    - The writing order matters
- D6~7: polishing
    - USE LLMs
- Key points
    - No wait
    - No read
    - No backward


# Writing a Publishable Paper [Ref. @McEnerney2014]

## Mindsets

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- You write to help think
 - *Don't wait until you are thinking everything through to start writing*
- A published paper needs "to be written (at least) [twice]{.red}"
    - You need to use two "languages" to write: 
        - a thinking language (for you) and a reading language (for readers)
- You need to have a sense of writing to whom before starting

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/ew_flow.png){.fragment fig-align="center" height=300}

- Your teachers do not always give the "right" comments and suggestions
    - Paid for reading
    - ~~Understand the world~~ [Evaluate you]{.red}

:::

::::

::: {.notes}

You create the text through the horizontal process, but it is the vertical process that decides whether it works.

1. Slowing down
1. reread over and over (only you have/are forced to read)
1. misunderstand
1. Stop

Never reach the understanding-the-world level: some instructors may say "no, students' work are amazing." Lier! You can asked them back: "do you publish them? how often do you read a student's paper when you don't have to"

:::

## What is worth to read

[Being [valuable]{.red} for the readers]{.fragment style="text-align:center; margin-top: 2em"}

- What's valuable
    - What do you do, when somebody says s/he doesn't understand you?
    - Why do you write for an academic paper? 
        - To convey your thoughts, to build up the knowledge?


::: {.notes}

When a PhD students come to my office, saying that this is important! I have to write about it!
What journal do you want to submit then? 
Why it matters?
It matters because value is the key! The readers are the key!
This is the problem caused by the examination in school: they do not teach you there are difference among readers

- What's valuable

Are you describing something ABOUT? 
Does your paper describe the "about"?
Is that what professional academic papers do? 
No, you may say, they are making arguments, are they different? 
No difference. 
The correct answer: is to tell YOU the question YOU have, and the solution

- What do you do, when somebody says s/he doesn't understand you?

You explain it...Don't do that
Because what you explain is to reveal what inside of your head---no one care what's in your head
Only teachers want to know what in your head: because they are paid for it

- to build up the knowledge

No, it is not.
it's to change your readers' ideas. "why should I think that"

:::


## The "correct" goal to write {background="#43464B"}

::: {.Large style="text-align:center; margin-top: 1em"}

+ Help the [readers]{.red} to understand what they want to understand better.
+ To move the [conversation]{.red} forward

## Who Are the Readers?

## Myth of value

- Original ~~is~~ valuable
    - New knowledge is pretty easy to create
- Knowledge ~~is~~ valuable

- New knowledge

how many people in this room? Nobody else in the world knows---but they don't care either.

- Knowledge

Ideally, knowledge is cumulative, the old stuff is always there like the left; but no, it is actually only a bunch of people deciding

In the western world, too male, too pale, too stale. (it's changing, way too long, way too small, way to slow, but changing; but except for that this is the real world)

The boundary of the knowledge is permeable (things coming in and out)

*Version A*:

> About democratic regimes and public support, there are two possible relationships. 
    One is that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong.
    The other is that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. 
    Some research find that countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. 
    The others found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

*Version B*:

    that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong, and that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. 
    But the evidence for either part of this claim has been decidedly mixed. 
    Countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. 
    Similarly, studies have alternately found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

- Instability

Attention, challenge, contradiction, redflag

Not only grammarly flow/transition words but showing the tensions

- Community

"Making things organized"? No, showing there is a community. I have read your stuff, and I have something to say

Why saying some readers are wrong can get published? With the entering code: wow, you are smart, you are fabulous, you are contributive, but there is a little stuff 

Risky, though: Saying you are great, but I have something new---why should I care about you?

# Writing efficient texts [Ref. @McEnerney2014;@Douglas2015]

## Simplity &#8655; efficiency

> What those of us who know Agee’s criticism almost by heart read over and over, however, is the reviews that appeared in *The Nation* [@Denby2006].

::: {.callout-note .fragment}

## Phases of processing work

1. Identify the words and their meaning;
2. Confirm their accuracy referring to the long-term memories;
3. Explicit inference that sentences are in a causal order (iconicity assumption)

:::

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}

## Three-step dance of reading

1. Lexical processing
2. Syntactic processing: use surrounding words to anticipate how the sentence will structurally play out
3. When the sentence's contents fail to make sense, then the inferential process

:::

::: {.notes}

the first two levels of processing occur together

:::

## Sentence: Clarity

> Creating [causal]{.red} relationships ("who do what")

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

1. Active over passive
    - Avoid "there be"
    - Exceptions:
        1. Use passive constructions if the entire section employ it or a lot of we/I involved otherwise
        1. When the actors are unknown or the outcomes is more important
        1. Legal liability

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

2. Use action verbs
3. Concrete subjects
4. Early and close S+V

:::

::::

## Action verbs

::: {.callout-note}

## Non-action verb

Was, appears, constitutes, represents, has been, make (a deal), give (a break), take (a hike)......

:::

- When using a non-action verb
    - your sentence [no longer tells a story]{.red}.
    - Non-action verbs are harder to remember
    - Make the sentence longer (by adding prepositions, prep.)

::: {.callout-caution}

## Examples

> **Bad**: Chess Aviation has an excellent concept. The idea of catering any service to the extremely wealthy has always been a viable idea. Airline service is necessary for most high-level executives of corporations, businessmen, and wealthy individuals. The airline service that is provided by commercial carriers is extremely poor. 
    [**Good**: The management team has built Chess Aviation around an excellent concept: catering to the extremely wealthy. Many high-net-worth individuals fly frequently, including wealthy businessmen and high-level executives of corporations. However, commercial air carriers tend to provide poor service, falling far short of what affluent people expect.]{.fragment}

:::

## Concrete objects

- Avoid isolated pronouns (this, that)
    - If you have to pair with a noun (this idea, that evidence)
    - Avoid using phrases and clauses as the grammatical subjects
    - Gerund phrases slow down the readers' speed and trigger needless cortical activation
        1. A verb doesn't perform as a verb 
        2. Stay in a place that confuse readers what it is grammatically 
        3. Encouraging writers to lard with more complicated clauses
    - If one can't avoid using a phrase as the subject, keep it short

::: {.callout-warning .fragment}

## Example

> **Bad**: Integrating the fragments gleaned from a sentence into a vast mental database to be recalled at a later point when they become useful could tax even a brain like Einstein’s.

:::

## S close to V

- Readers won't begin comprehending sentences until reaching the subject
    - Readers notice less the details before the subject or between the subject and verb
    - Basic format: Subject first, then verb, then details

::: {.callout-warning .fragment}

## Example

> **Bad**: The short longevity of most common restorations and especially those of resin-based composite materials calls for detailed studies of factors which may lead to an extension of the lifetime of restorations

:::

## Sentence: Concision

1. Avoid redundant pairs
    - When using "n. and n.," think about removing one n.
1. Avoid redundant modifiers
    - Adj. and adv.
1. Avoid negatives
1. Avoid narrating or hedging
1. Avoid throat-clearing, e.g., in order to 

- Concision Principle #2: Avoid redundantmodifiers (Douglas, 2015, p. 238)
- Concision Principle #3: Avoid negatives (Douglas, 2015, p. 242)
- Concision Principle #4: Avoid narrating orhedging (Douglas, 2015, p. 245)
    
## Metadiscourse

- Metadiscourse: writing about the act of writing
    - Transitions: but,however,inaddition, first, last, for example  
    - Frame Markers: this study proposes to, we intend to, in conclusion  
    - Evidentials:  according to a White House source, Douglas et al. state  
    - Hedges: virtually, probably, in all likelihood, most likely
    - Boosters: indeed, clearly, evidently, of course
    - Engagement Markers: This attitude contrasts strikingly with our expectations for the way readers’ brains  process metadiscourse;  This methodology relies on retrospective data analysis, lending itself to biased  interpretations of data
    - Attitude Markers: We were surprised to discover; I can only imagine your distress at this development
    - Self-mentions: I find this researcher's explanation to be clever but also slick and insufficiently explanatory for why our brains respond to art; I can recall sharing our community's outrage during that media event; I am convinced I'm the perfect candidate for this research fellowship.

- Principles of using metadiscourse:  
    1. Use frame makers only in the form of transition;  
    2. Incorporate evidentials into the central sentence structure  
    3. Use self-mentions/engagement markers only to establish a conversational tone  
    4. Avoid all other metadiscourse, esp. emphatics and boosters  
    5. Transitions should not be restricted

## Sentences: Continuity

> Let the readers understand the [relationship]{.red} between sentences.

::: {.callout-important}

## Memory ladder

The last > the beginning > the middle

:::

1. Place the most important information at the ends of things
2. Use transitions to tie sentences together
3. Sequence information in sentences in a familiar–unfamiliar pattern
4. Try to keep grammatical subjects consistent from sentence to sentence

::: {.callout-tip}

## How to use the above principles

- Use the continuity principle #1 and a mixture of 2--5
- Continuity is more important than clarity

:::

## Place the most important information at the ends of things

- The emphasis range: the last 1/3~1/4 of the sentence
- Less important at the beginning or else where: e.g., prepositional phrases (where and when) are least important in most cases, they should put at the beginning not the end of a sentence

::: {.callout-warning}

## Example

> **Bad**: My manager tore my proposal to shreds, told me I was a waste of space, then demanded I pack up my desk and get the hell out of the office during last week. 
 **Good**: Last week, my manager tore my proposal to shreds, told me I was a waste of space, then demanded I pack up my desk and leave.

:::

## Be careful with long sentences

::: {.callout-warning}

## Example

> **Bad**: Wolfe certainly invokes the key figures---William James, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Charles Sanders Peirce (rather sheepishly)---but he also draws upon Immanuel Kant, Jean-Paul Sartre, René Descartes, as well as more current figures such as Chantal Mouffe, Ernesto Laclau, and Cornel West, if only to remind us that pragmatism, especially Rorty’s strain, may want to express an alterity, an outside of “theory,” but it is very much a part of the system.

:::


- Three sins of long sentences: 
    1. Few cues about which information is important that readers should remember 
    2. Long sentences also has the same proportion of emphasis 
    3. Demand more working memory 
- Same logic: List fewer than six items


## Use transitions

- Transitions have to appear towards the beginning to be effective
    - Approximately every two to three sentences
    - "Also" or "too" at the end of the sentence is not effective for transition

::: {.callout-warning}

## Example

> **Bad**: Rogers, Sanborn & Son had left the project and the site in limbo for several years. The team discussed the liabilities of building on the site, the difficulties in minimizing the environmental impacts, and the necessity of driving foundations on piles, then Sanders & Co. decided to give up on the project, too. 
 **Good**: Rogers, Sanborn & Son left the project and the site in limbo for over five years. Similarly, Sanders & Co. also decided to give up on the project after the team discussed the project’s numerous challenges. These challenges include (1) the liabilities of building on the site, (2) difficulties in minimizing environmental impacts, and (3) the necessity of driving foundations on piles.

:::

## Sequence information

::: {.callout-note}

## Referential continuity

The later sentence refers implicitly or explicitly to the preceding sentence

:::

- Referential continuity make stronger recall
    - People process familiar information before new and automatically see relevance in statements with their world


::: {.callout-warning}

## Example

> **Bad**: Banks within a particular market tried to shore up their particular market share, a practice that left them exposed to a buyout. Other banking institutions were expanding outside their current markets. The federal government could force an institution to sell itself to a buyer that the federal government had already chosen. The buyer normally bought the bank being sold because the bank’s sale price had fallen beneath its market value.
 **Good**: Banks within a particular market tried to shore up their respective market share, a practice that left banks exposed to a buyout. This practice allowed for other banking institutions to expand outside their current markets. In some cases the federal government could force the entity to sell itself to a buyer that the federal government had already chosen. When given this option, the buyer normally bought the bank being sold because the bank’s sale price had fallen beneath its market value.

:::

## Repetition is not a bad thing

- Two reasons why repetition of key concepts as the grammatical subject is good: 
    1. The priming effect mark the subjects as important 
    2. The priming effect enables readers to recognize the topic of the paragraphs, i.e., the macrostructure of the paragraph
- When writers use multiple terms to refer to the same thing, readers get confused
- Frequently using one concept improve readers' recalling rate
    - Eye-tracking evidence: 
        1. Readers pause significantly at the beginning of sentences 
        2. Readers read faster when the sentences refer to the preceding sentence 
        3. Readers focus on common wordings


## Sentences: Cadence

## Paragraphs: Coherence

> Giving readers predictions

- Shorter paragraphs -> less cognitive overhead 
    - Frequent changes in focus -> maintaining readers' interest

1. Begin each paragraph with a set of comprehensive overview sentences, a paragraph head
2. Support each paragraph’s head with a body
3. Place your thesis at the end of the head paragraph(s)
4. Apply paragraph head and body organization to the entire document

::: {.callout-tip}

## How people read emails

Readers of online text (email, etc.) usually focus only on the first few liens of the first paragraph and then those of the next

:::

::: {.callout-important}

Coherence is more important than continuity or clarity!

:::



## Paragraph heads

> Paragraph head promises; paragraph body delivers

- The first sentence is an overture not a topic sentence: an overview rather than cram everything into a single sentence
    - Use two or three sentences if necessary as the head, just make sure being at the the beginning of a paragraph 
    - Functions of paragraph heads: 
        1. Priming readers 
        2. Giving linguistic cues 
        3. Providing explicit indications
    - Don't make the paragraph head longer than a third of the paragraph

::: {.callout-warning}

## Example

> **Bad**: For the large competitors such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, and the others, their biggest strength is their name and the resources available to them. These companies are able to enter almost any market and to provide employees with a particular expertise in the client’s subject matter. The major weakness, however, exists in these companies’ overhead and the lack of specialization in a particular area. With resources spread all over the country and world these companies can find costly and time-consuming the effort of bringing the right employees together. This location issue and high overhead costs translate into high billing rates. These high billing rates of the “Big Four” consulting firms are heavily watched by the senior executives in our client’s firm. As a result, we find it often difficult, even impossible, to sign longterm contracts with our clients because we are one of the “Big Four” and such an engagement would set off red flags with the senior executives. Our smaller competitors have realized these weaknesses and have designed business models to get around many of the issues faced by the largest competitors in the industry.
**Good**: The size and reputation of the “Big Four” accounting agencies can actually work against them where clients are concerned. With resources scattered nation- and world-wide, Big Four agencies often expend substantial costs merely bringing the right employees together. Unfortunately, these location and overhead costs translate into high billing rates. As a result of these costly rates, many clients seek out smaller firms, since senior executives would view contracting with PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, and others as needlessly costly. On the other hand, our smaller competitors have realized these weaknesses and designed business models to take advantage of them.

## Example

> **Bad**: The “hands-on” approach with personal instruction certainly appeals to the typical student. Although labeled as innovative, the approach outlined by Mr. Hutton details no new techniques for training that differentiate ITS from competitors. With 15 students anticipated per class, Mr. Hutton’s ability to provide individual attention to a particular student will be constrained. Also, the business plan fails to make clear the range of services ITS will provide. Furthermore, small businesses may be unwilling to invest in training for standard software applications, like the programs in Microsoft Office, since most entry-level jobs now require these skills of would-be employees.
**Good**: Throughout Irish history, countless generations of exiles have cast off from the shores of Ireland in search of sanctuary, adventure and alliances. After the signing of the Treaty of Limerick in 1691, the “Flight of the Wild Geese” marked the watershed moment of Irish migration to the European Continent. Nineteen thousand Catholic Irishmen and their families sailed to France in the hope of one day returning to free Ireland from English tyranny. For the next hundred years ships arriving on the west coast of Ireland would depart with Irish recruits listed in ships’ manifests as “Wild Geese” for the armies of Europe. Using this label to escape detection by English authorities, these Wild Geese would serve in armies across the Continent, including Napoleon’s. Ultimately, these Irish soldiers and their descendants would fan out across Europe and eventually influence power, politics, and business throughout the Continent well into the twentieth century.

## How to create paragraph heads

Good paragraph head: Provide specific guides of the following sentences, such as I will give *three* points... 

- Strategies to create paragraph heads
    1. Try sketching out your points for your paragraphs on a scrap of paper before you begin writing each one.
    2. Write a brief sentence or two that cover the contents of those points.
    3. Work on your paragraph heads in even informal modes of writing, like email.
    4. Focus on identifying paragraph heads whenever you read any form of published writing.

## Don't overload your paragraph head

Paragraph head only about the immediate paragraph not multiple

:::


## Paragraph body

- Should be at least twice longer than the head sentences
- Never introduce a topic in your paragraph body that you haven’t mentioned or covered in your paragraph head
- Place the thesis at the end of the head paragraph(s)
    - The thesis sentence is a one-sentence summary
    - Recency effect: the ends are more able to be recalled
        - Put the thesis sentence at the end of the introductory paragraphs to prime the recency effect
        - Use a preliminary thesis at the end of the first paragraph to inform the main topic of the document before the real thesis comes out
- End complexity stuff with a conclusion paragraph/sentence: a one-sentence summary of the paragraph's takeaways

## Example

> **Bad**: On a Friday morning in April, I strapped on a headset, leaned into a microphone, and experienced what had been described to me as a type of time travel to the future of higher education. I was on the ninth floor of a building in downtown San Francisco, in a neighborhood whose streets are heavily populated with winos and vagrants, and whose buildings host hip new businesses, many of them tech start-ups. In a small room, I was flanked by a publicist and a tech manager from an educational venture called the Minerva Project, whose founder and CEO, the 39-year-old entrepreneur Ben Nelson, aims to replace (or, when he is feeling less aggressive, “reform”) the modern liberal-arts college.

## Document heads

1. Introducing the wording 
2. Central points of the document 
3. Repetition to make emphases

::: {.callout-tip}

## Don't

The document head should skip the backstory.
That's why the so-called "研究背景" is nonsense

## Myth you wish never learned

["Never write long sentences"]{style="text-align:center; margin-top: 2em"}

> With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations [@Lincoln1865].

> 在这个时候，我们提出划分敌我和人民内部两类矛盾的界限，提出正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，以便团结全国各族人民进行一场新的战争——向自然界开战，发展我们的经济，发展我们的文化，使全体人民比较顺利地走过目前的过渡时期，巩固我们的新制度，建设我们的新国家，就是十分必要的了。[@MaoZeDong1957]
