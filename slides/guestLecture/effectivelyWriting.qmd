# Writing a Paper <br> in a Week [Ref. @Carr2016]

## When should you use it

- Goal
    - An [above-B+]{.red} paper for a course
    - A [qualified]{.red} piece in a good/professional shape
- Before the week
    - Read the syllabus or whatever requirements
    - Finished the literature review (in person and/or with Large Language Models, LLMs)


## D1~2: Framework

- Opening a new document in Word, or take a blank sheet
- Writing down the "creative" point(s) of the paper
    - A.k.a. the one or two sentences that you want the readers to get after reading the piece
- Writing the outline
    1. Figures and tables
    2. Basic frame
        + Introduction
        + Literature Review
        + Theory
        + Method and Data
        + Analysis and Results
        + Discussion and Conclusion
        + Reference [leaving this to the bibliography manager]{.fragment}

## D3~5: Drafting

1. Writing out the main points of each section
    - Bullet points
1. Finishing the "Method and Data" section
    + Setup the terminology
1. Finishing the "Analysis and Results" section
    + Setup the major findings
1. Finishing the "Conclusion" section
    + Summarize the findings
    + Talk to the (broad) literature
1. Finishing the "Introduction" section
1. Give a good title of the paper

## D6~7: Polising

1. Check for grammar, spelling, phrasing errors (w. LLMs)
    - English: Claude > ChatGPT > others
    - Chinese: Deepseek/Qwen > others
1. Remove LLM traces
1. Check the format of references

## Key points

[No procrastinate!]{.fragment}

[No more readings!]{.fragment}

[No backward editing and correcting!]{.fragment}

## How to write readable sentences

::: {.r-hstack}

![@Strunk1999](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/ew_styles.jpg){fig-align="center" height=600}

![@WilliamsBizup2014](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/ew_elementOfStyle.jpg){fig-align="center" height=600}

:::



## Clarity

- Make main characters subjects.
- Make important actions verbs
    + reduce nominalization of verbs.
- When to use nominalization:
    + As a short subject refers to a previous sentence
    + As a motivation ("the fact that" sb. does sth).
    + As the object of the verb
    + A concept so familiar to your readers

::: {.notes}

+ The nominalization as a short subject refers to a previous sentence (e.g., these arguments, this decision.)
+ The nominalization refers to "the fact that" sb. does sth.
+ A nominalization names what would be the OBJECT of the verb, the "what" or "whom" of the verb.
+ A nominalization refers to a concept so familiar to your readers that to them, it is a virtual character

:::

## Coherence

+ Underline the [first five or six words]{.red} in every sentence, and check if they constitute a relatively [small set]{.red} of related ideas and if they name the most important characters.
+ Use the [topic as the subject]{.red}, and put them at the beginning of the sentences.
+ [Don't vary]{.red} the subjects of the sentences frequently
+ Change a little only when the same words for the same topic were times used in the same positions of sentences.
+ [Don't overuse]{.red} "and, also, moreover, another, and so on", words that simply "Here's one more thing."
+ [Don't use]{.red} "but, however, therefore, or consequently" too frequently.


## Elegence

* Revise long sentence
    + Get to the subject of the main clause quickly
    + Get to the verb and object quickly
    + Avoid sprawls (which, that, who + is/was)
    + Drop "although" with a long clause
    + Drop "since" with a long clause
* Balance
    + with coordination (and, or, nor, but, and yet)
    + without coordination but with similarly structure in each clause.
* Climactic Emphasis: leave heavy words at the end
    + Heavy: n. > a./ad. > prep.

## Wrap up

- Preparation
- D1~2: construct the framework
    - Bullet points
- D3~5: drafting
    - The writing order matters
- D6~7: polishing
    - USE LLMs
- Key points
    - No wait
    - No read
    - No backward


# Writing a Publishable Paper [Ref. @McEnerney2014]

## Mindsets

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- You write to help think
    - *Don't wait until you are thinking everything through to start writing*
- A published paper needs "to be written (at least) [twice]{.red}"
    - You need to use two "languages" to write: 
        - a thinking language (for you) and a reading language (for readers)
- You need to have a sense of writing to whom before starting

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/ew_flow.png){.fragment fig-align="center" height=300}

- Your teachers do not always give the "right" comments and suggestions
    - Paid for reading
    - ~~Understand the world~~ [Evaluate you]{.red}

:::

::::

::: {.notes}

You create the text through the horizontal process, but it is the vertical process that decides whether it works.

1. Slowing down
1. reread over and over (only you have/are forced to read)
1. misunderstand
1. Stop

Never reach the understanding-the-world level: some instructors may say "no, students' work are amazing." Lier! You can asked them back: "do you publish them? how often do you read a student's paper when you don't have to"

:::

## What is worth to read

[Being [valuable]{.red} for the readers]{.fragment style="text-align:center; margin-top: 2em"}

- What's valuable
    - What do you do, when somebody says s/he doesn't understand you?
    - Why do you write for an academic paper? 
        - To convey your thoughts, to build up the knowledge?


::: {.notes}

When a PhD students come to my office, saying that this is important! I have to write about it!
What journal do you want to submit then? 
Why it matters?
It matters because value is the key! The readers are the key!
This is the problem caused by the examination in school: they do not teach you there are difference among readers

- What's valuable

Are you describing something ABOUT? 
Does your paper describe the "about"?
Is that what professional academic papers do? 
No, you may say, they are making arguments, are they different? 
No difference. 
The correct answer: is to tell YOU the question YOU have, and the solution

- What do you do, when somebody says s/he doesn't understand you?

You explain it...Don't do that
Because what you explain is to reveal what inside of your head---no one care what's in your head
Only teachers want to know what in your head: because they are paid for it

- to build up the knowledge

No, it is not.
it's to change your readers' ideas. "why should I think that"

:::


## The "correct" goal to write  {background="#43464B"}

::: {.Large style="text-align:center; margin-top: 1em"}

+ Help the [readers]{.red} to understand what they want to understand better.
+ To move the [conversation]{.red} forward

:::


## Who Are the Readers?

> Nothing would be accepted to be knowledge until it is challenged [by who are competent to challenge]{.red}.

::: {.fragment style="text-align:center; margin-top: 1em"}

&dArr;

Peer-Review System

&dArr;

Readers who have the professional function to challenge    
a.k.a., editors and reviewers

:::

::: {.callout-warning .fragment style="text-align:center; margin-top: 1em"}

##  Be aware

These readers [DON'T]{.red} trust you; they assume you are [WASTING]{.red} their time.

:::

## Myth of value

- Original ~~is~~ valuable
    - New knowledge is pretty easy to create
- Knowledge ~~is~~ valuable

::: {.r-hstack .fragment}

:::

::: {.notes}

- New knowledge

how many people in this room? Nobody else in the world knows---but they don't care either.

- Knowledge

Ideally, knowledge is cumulative, the old stuff is always there like the left; but no, it is actually only a bunch of people deciding

In the western world, too male, too pale, too stale. (it's changing, way too long, way too small, way to slow, but changing; but except for that this is the real world)

The boundary of the knowledge is permeable (things coming in and out)

## Every community has its own codes

::::{.overlay-container}

::: {.overlay-text}

*Version A*:

> About democratic regimes and public support, there are two possible relationships. 
    One is that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong.
    The other is that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. 
    Some research find that countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. 
    The others found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

:::

::: {.overlay-text-over .fragment}

*Version B*: 

> It has long been argued that democratic regimes and public support for them are mutually reinforcing: 
    that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong, and that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. 
    But the evidence for either part of this claim has been decidedly mixed. 
    Countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. 
    Similarly, studies have alternately found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

Countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite.

[*Codes of instability*]{.red}    
[Codes of community]{.blue}

::: {.notes}

- Instability

Attention, challenge, contradiction, redflag

Not only grammarly flow/transition words but showing the tensions

- Community

"Making things organized"? No, showing there is a community. I have read your stuff, and I have something to say

Why saying some readers are wrong can get published? With the entering code: wow, you are smart, you are fabulous, you are contributive, but there is a little stuff 

Risky, though: Saying you are great, but I have something new---why should I care about you?

# Writing efficient texts [Ref. @McEnerney2014;@Douglas2015]

## Simplity &#8655; efficiency

> What those of us who know Agee’s criticism almost by heart  read over and over, however, is the reviews that appeared in *The Nation* [@Denby2006].

## Phases of processing work

1. Identify the words and their meaning;
2. Confirm their accuracy referring to the long-term memories;
3. Explicit inference that sentences are in a causal order (iconicity assumption)

:::

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}

## Three-step dance of reading

1. Lexical processing
2. Syntactic processing: use surrounding words to anticipate how the sentence will structurally play out
3. When the sentence's contents fail to make sense, then the inferential process

:::

::: {.notes}

the first two levels of processing occur together

:::

## Sentence: Clarity

::: {.callout-important}

Golden rule: creating causal relationships ("who do what")

:::

1. Active over passive
    - Avoid "there be"
    - Exceptions:
        1. Use passive constructions if the entire section employ it or a lot of we/I involved otherwise
        1. When the actors are unknown or the outcomes is more important
        1. Legal liability
1. Use action verbs
1. Concrete subjects
1. Early and close S+V

## Action verbs

::: {.callout-note}

## Non-action verb

Was, appears, constitutes, represents, has been, make (a deal), give (a break), take (a hike)......

:::

- When using a non-action verb
    - your sentence [no longer tells a story]{.red}.
    - Non-action verbs are harder to remember
    - Make the sentence longer (by adding prepositions, prep.)

::: {.callout-caution}

## Examples

> **Bad**: Chess Aviation has an excellent concept. The idea of catering  any service to the extremely wealthy has always been a viable idea. Airline service is necessary for most high-level  executives of corporations, businessmen, and wealthy  individuals. The airline service that is provided by commercial  carriers is extremely poor.    
    [**Good**: The management team has built Chess Aviation around an excellent concept: catering to the extremely wealthy. Many high-net-worth individuals fly frequently, including wealthy businessmen and high-level executives of corporations. However, commercial air carriers tend to provide poor service, falling far short of what affluent people expect.]{.fragment}

:::

## Concrete objects

- Avoid isolated pronouns (this, that)
    - If you have to pair with a noun (this idea, that evidence)
    - Avoid using phrases and clauses as the grammatical subjects
    - Gerund phrases slow down the readers' speed and trigger needless cortical activation
        1. A verb doesn't perform as a verb  
        2. Stay in a place that confuse readers what it is grammatically  
        3. Encouraging writers to lard with more complicated clauses
    - If one can't avoid using a phrase as the subject, keep it short

::: {.callout-warning .fragment}

## Example

> **Bad**: Integrating the fragments gleaned from a sentence into a vast mental database to be recalled at a later point when they become useful could tax even a brain like Einstein’s.

:::

## Sentence: Concision

1. Avoid redundant pairs
    - When using "n. and n.," think about removing one n.
1. Avoid redundant modifiers
    - Adj. and adv.
1. Avoid negatives
    - 
1. Avoid narrating or hedging
1. Avoid throat-clearing, e.g., in order to
