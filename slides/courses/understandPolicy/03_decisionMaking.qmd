:::{.notes}
By Maurice Allais, Nobel Prize in Economics in 1988

Experiment on real people: more people pick blue pile and yellow piles

People should consistently select left or right strategy, rather than blue and yellow or red and green. 

The experiment shows most people chose blue plus yellow, indicating that people choose what to gain or loose right now, not on the final outcome, and certainty over risk.

Placed after Gagarin (加加林), Bay of Pigs

猪湾事件（英语：Bay of Pigs Invasion），是1961年4月17日，在中央情报局的协助下流亡美国的古巴人，在古巴西南海岸猪湾（吉隆滩，Playa Girón），向菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导的古巴革命政府发动的一次失败的入侵。猪湾事件标志着美国反古巴行动的第一个高峰。

在联合国安全理事会针对美国的这次进攻是否合法的讨论中，古巴指责美国非法进攻的提议被美国否决。

对美国来说这次失败的行动不但是一次军事上的失败，而且也是一次政治上的失误。肯尼迪误信CIA过分乐观的情报外，也不打算派美军收拾反而切割卸责，使得国内外对这次行动的批评非常强烈，刚刚上任90天的约翰·肯尼迪政府为此大失信誉，相反的卡斯特罗政权和古巴革命得到巩固。由于古巴担心美国再次进攻，因此古巴开始与苏联靠近，最终导致了1962年的古巴导弹危机。

## Space Shuttle in a Incremental System

1. Identification: Gagarin, Bay of Pigs
1. Development

    - The president's budget bureau [doubted]{.red} the benefits.


## 3. Selection

> Everyone is a shuttle designer

+ No long-range plan
+ No agreement on objectives
+ [One step at a time]{.red}
+ Officials pursue similar goals for different reasons
+ The program turns to satisfy multiple constituencies with unresolved interests.

## 4. Dynamic factors

> We must think of (space activities) as part of a continuing process…and not as a series of separate leaps, each requiring a [massive concentration]{.red} of energy...Space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities.  
---Richard M. Nixon (March 7, 1970)

The increased complexity of a shuttle designed to be all things to all people created [inherently greater risks than if more realistic technical goals]{.red} had been set at the start...The greatest compromise NASA made was...with the premise of the vehicle itself.

## Heuristics and Bias

![](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/rat_heuristic.jpg){fig-align="center" height=200}

> Whilst heuristics can speed up our problem-solving and decision-making processes, they can introduce errors and bias judgements.   
---Dale 2015

- Hueristics: 
    1. Representativeness
    1. Availability
    1. Anchor

:::{.notes}
举不举得起来，用脚踢

Tversky & Kahneman 1974

This article described three heuristics that are employed in making judgments under uncertainty: (i) representativeness, which is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event A belongs to class or process B; (ii) availability of instances or scenarios, which is often employed when people are asked to assess the frequency of a class or the plausibility of a particular development; and (iii) adjustment from an anchor, which is usually employed in numerical prediction when a relevant value is available. These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgments and decisions in situations of uncertainty.

individuals disproportionately stick with the status quo, which is an important reference point

Loss aversion + Reference dependency

people make decisions based on the potential gain or losses relative to their specific situation (the reference point) rather than in absolute terms; this is referred to as reference dependence.

Faced with a risky choice leading to gains, individuals are risk-averse, preferring solutions that lead to a lower expected utility but with a higher certainty (concave value function).
Faced with a risky choice leading to losses, individuals are risk-seeking, preferring solutions that lead to a lower expected utility as long as it has the potential to avoid losses (convex value function).

e.g., of the third face: Appalachian coal miners. The mining company remains dominant and the miners cannot conceive of a situation. When the miners show some signs of rebelling, the dominant interests are able to ignore pressure for change. In the long run, people may stop fighting as they become and remain alienated from politics; quiescence is the result.
