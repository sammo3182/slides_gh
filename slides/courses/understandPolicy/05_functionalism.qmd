## Annotated Bibliography (AB)

Steps to get a good AB:

- **Topic Selection:** Choose a specific public policy issue you wish to analyze.      
  - Ensure your topic is [not too broad]{.red}; 
    - It should be focused enough to allow for an [empirical]{.red} investigation.
- **Research:** 
    - 5 [academic]{.red} articles
    - New articles are favored
- **Evaluation:** Critically evaluate each source for its credibility, relevance, and contributions to the field of public policy regarding your topic. 
    - Consider the authors' qualifications, the publication date, and the source's purpose.
    
---
    
- **Citation:** For each source, provide a consistent and well-used reference format, e.g., APSR, APA.
- **Annotation:** Below each citation, write an annotation that summarizes the source's key points, its relevance to your topic, and any critical insights or findings.
    - More than one sentence at least

## Example 1 (Overqualified)

> Smith, J. A., & Doe, E. B. (2020). The impact of environmental policy on economic growth. *Journal of Public Policy Analysis*, 35(4), 645-669.

**Annotation:** [This article explores the relationship between environmental regulation and economic growth, using a comparative analysis of policies in the United States and Germany. The authors employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative interviews. Their findings suggest that while strict environmental policies may have a short-term negative impact on economic growth, they contribute to sustainable development in the long term.]{.blue} [This source is particularly relevant to my project as it provides a nuanced perspective on the economic effects of environmental policies, a central theme in my analysis. The methodology section also offers insights into effective research designs for policy analysis.]{.red}

## Example 2 (Overqualified)

> Lee, C. R. (2019). Education reform and student performance: A review of state policies. *Education Policy Review*, 27(2), 234-255.

**Annotation:** [Lee's comprehensive review article assesses the impact of various state-level education reforms on student academic performance in the United States. By synthesizing results from multiple empirical studies, the author identifies key factors that contribute to the success or failure of educational policies. Lee argues for a balanced approach to reform, one that considers both accountability measures and support for educators.]{.blue} [This source is invaluable for my proposal, as it highlights the complexity of education policy and the need for evidence-based approaches. The extensive bibliography provides a useful starting point for further research.]{.red}

Sociology: Emile [ei'mi:l] Durkheim [ˈdɜːkhaɪm], 涂尔干

In social sciences, functionalism is a theory based on the premise that all aspects of a society serve a purpose and that all are indispensable for the long-term survival of the society. The approach gained prominence in the works of 19th-century sociologists, particularly those who viewed societies as organisms. 

In philosophy, functionalism in the philosophy of mind is the doctrine that what makes something a mental state of a particular type **does not depend on its internal constitution, but rather on the way it functions**, or the role it plays, in the system of which it is a part. 

In architecture, functionalism is a style of architecture that emerged in the early 20th century, characterized by an emphasis on function and utility over ornamentation and aesthetics.

1. Constructing Structures with functions
1. Incorporating system changes

:::{.notes}
what does a structure (guerrilla movement, political party, election, etc.) do within the political system (of country x)? 
:::


## Define functional structure in layers

- Outer-layer: system
    - A interdependent [integrity]{.red} of within parts and a [boundary]{.red} from the environment
    - Conversion process, basic pattern maintenance, and various capabilities (distributive, symbolic, etc.)

:::{.callout-note .fragment}
## Countries under a structural functionalist view

Developing countries have a simpler system, and developed have a complex one, but both have structures with [similar functions]{.red}.
:::


- Middle-layer: structures
    - Maintain or change system characteristics
    - Organizations and institutions, e.g., political party, legislature, executive, judiciary, interest group, officials


## Inner Layer： Functions

- System(structure(function)) 
    - Interacts with domestic and foreign environments
    - Input and output (🥳)
        - Input: political socialization & recruitment, interest articulation/aggregation, and political communication
        - Output: rule-making, rule implementation/adjudication

:::{.callout-caution .fragment}
Some structures may perform others' function: executive has legislature functions

- the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has been instrumental in cutting over 100,000 jobs and freezing foreign aid. This level of restructuring typically requires legislative approval, but Trump has leveraged executive orders to bypass Congress.

# Deconstructing Structural Functionalism

## Microanalytic View

> Where rational choice theory wants to simplify, the micro-version of structural-functionalism calls for enrichment [@Lane1994, p.466].


:::{.large .fragment .nonincremtnal style="text-align:center; margin-top: 2em"}
*Focus*

1. Actors
1. Goal (Interests)
1. Interaction
:::

## Dissect the process

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Actors**

The actors are [groups]{.blue}: 

1. Elites
1. Masses
1. Governments

:::{.fragment}
*Any individuals in this picture?*
:::

:::{.notes}
Yes, leaders
:::

:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**Goal**

Actors have [fixed]{.red} preference orders and move *strategically* to *maximize* their interests.

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
*Where are the interests from?*

- Economics: Utility function  
- Poli sci/sociologist: Non-universal, narrow, monetary &check;

## Interaction (Micro &rarr; Macro, changes)

1. Each actor evaluates goals and opportunities &rarr; conform/fight
1. Game
    + All actor conform &rarr; system stable
    + Fighter vs. conformer &rarr; fighter wins
    + Fighter vs. fighter &rarr; "Stronger" wins
1. Winners [rerule]{.red} the system
1. The process repeats in the new system.

conform: following the existing rule

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
*Contribution*

- &rarr; system theory: Bring the [variety]{.blue} and [variance]{.blue} into the system:
    1. Varieties of the institutions, leaders, social configurations
    1. Variances in space and time
- &rarr; rational choice: 
    1. Dynamics and variance of goals and interests
    1. Micro-macro connection
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
*Issues*

1. Concept stretching: e.g., system, interactions
1. Actor exclusion
1. Normative bias
1. "A theory about social wholes as social wholes"?
