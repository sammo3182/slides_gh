## Common Paths of SNA

1. Value judging
1. Story telling
1. Narrative analysis
1. Dramaturgical analysis
1. Category analysis

## Value Judging

.pull-left[
+ Identifying "communities of meaning"
+ Studying the framing and interactions among the communities

Graham Tillett Allison Jr. , American political scientist and professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, in his book of Essence of decision, he attributed the missile crisis of Cuba to Russia's ideological flaws.

Another example: George Lakoff: Don't Think of an Elephant! 

Writing about framing and metaphor, a book writing for liberal peoples. Thus called them (Democrats) the 进步的, the Republicans 保守派

---

## Story Telling

Telling stories about a certain group or policy based on archives and interviews.

## Data Collection

1. Observing with intention to .red[understand];

1. Interviewing with respondents as .red[conversational] partner;

1. Reading the documents as they were writing .red[meaningfully].

3. Chock, Phyllis Pease. 1995. “Ambiguity in Policy Discourse: Congressional Talk about Immigration.” Policy Sciences 28(2): 165–84.

By examining the written record of spoken language, she was able to analyze the ways in which legislators’ and expert witnesses’ embedded ideas about immigrants reflected and shaped immigration reform and policy contentions.

## Analysis

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
.center[
No need to transform words into numbers
]
]

--

+ Numbers are not the results but the sources

--

+ More details than digits

???

Narrative reports often read like novels.

--

- Focus:
  + Where did the number or whatever data come from?
  + Where to find the data, what are data, how to know what are saying in the data?...

???

Analysis and collection are intertwined.

# How to Conduct Good SNA

## Evaluating SNA

.pull-left[

~~Be objective~~

Reality is not universal;
Policy is constructed.

]

--

.pull-right[

~~Be voiceless~~    
.center[<img src="images/small_Beauvoir.jpg" height = 200 />]

]

???

西蒙娜·德·波伏娃

Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, gender is constructed.

One is not born a woman, but becomes one.

--

.pull-left[

~~Be experimental~~

The SNA assumes impacts and multicausality are data and useful.

]

--

.pull-right[
~~Be replicated~~

.center[<img src="images/small_twins.gif" height = 150 />]

]

---

~~Be generalized~~

.center[<img src="images/small_yangQihan.jpg" height = 500 />]

---

## Evaluation System

+ Credibility
+ Transferability
+ Dependability
+ Confirmability

---

### Credibility

<video width="1000" height="500" controls preload>
    <source src="https://link.jscdn.cn/1drv/aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3YvcyFBcnR0dk83MHdLSU8yME5DWDFZUUFNX19vNWhYP2U9R3Q4cWFS.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

???

If the data and implications are presented credibly.

Based on enough description and background

e.g. Censorship, social desirability

---

### Transferability

> 当年的SARS也属于冠状病毒，公众容易将二者相类比。当年在应对SARS的过程中，我们是有过教训的。这就提醒我们，千万不可产生轻敌心态和麻痹思想，更不能犯下和当年一样的错误。  

.pull-right[---"尽快掐灭疫情传播的'火种'"《人民日报客户端》（2020-01-22）]

???

a result of detailed, illustrative description, and the responsibility shifts from the researcher (the sender) to individuals in other settings (the receivers)

https://wap.peopleapp.com/article/5060699/4954813

Should we learn from Singapore?

--

Readers' call, though.

---

### Dependability

Legit process of inquiry

+ What kinds of data, what period of time? 
+ Over a determined period of time, or simply one visit and a few interviews?  
...


???

Censorship

Authoritarianism, communist capitalism can be used to describe nowadays China?

---

### Confirmability

Findings clearly linked to analysis, data, and the research site.

.center[<img src="images/small_rumor.jpg" height = 400 />]

???

There's an alternative set of criteria which is more philosophical,

## A Good ?-N Analysis

| Large-N           | Small-N           |
|---------------|---------------|
| Objective     | Understanding |
| Voiceless     | Voice         |
| Experimental  | Comparison    |
| Replicable    | Depth         |
| Generalizable | Context       |

Always care about the framing and understanding an issue from different angles.

???

+ Understanding: the researchers' background, view, approach, and value; 钟南山更可信
+ Voice: Study by Bourgois and Schonberg (2009) of homeless men and women who were addicted to drugs is compelling because it showed they care.
+ Comparison: reflexivity: Well-crafted studies provide the reader an opportunity to reflect on his or own situations in regard to similarities and differences.
+ Depth: richesness for understanding and context differences
+ Context: not only if policy works, but what cases not and why
