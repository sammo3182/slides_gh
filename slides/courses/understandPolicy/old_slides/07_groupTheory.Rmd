By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, .red[adverse] to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

The government plays an active role in establishing the conditions for interest groups to act.

### Government Process

+ Government institutions: .red[Politicized] interest groups. 
+ Interest groups' .red[characteristics] influence governmental decisions. 
+ Diversity makes policy-making .red[flexible].


???

The interest groups' **strategic position** in the society (groups' status and prestige; their standing against the rules of the game; government membership in these groups; their usefulness as a source of information) and **internal characteristics** of both the interest groups (degree of organization; the skills of the leadership; and resources/money) and **governmental institutions** (operating structure; groups' effects on particular branches of the government) affect the influence on governmental decisions.  
The political structure of the U.S. government (federalism, liberty, rights) allows potential interest groups to rise and therefore play a role in representing interests.  
Diversity and will accommodate policy-making and will make it more flexible.

## How to Deal with Interest groups:

Control vs. Prevention?

---

## Control

> "Only working in a republic" --- Madison

--

*Why*:

+ A .red[large] one (diverse interest groups)
+ Under federalism (making .red[local] matter)

--

*Not fit pure democracy*:

+ Only the representatives can construct common interests (Madison).

???

The principle of popular sovereignty should prevent minority factions from gaining power.

## Prevention

According to Madison, remove the causes of faction
+ Destroying liberty
+ Creating a society homogeneous in opinions and interests

严肃党内政治生活贵在经常、重在认真、要在细节。党中央权威，全党都必须自觉维护，并具体体现到自己的全部工作中去，决不能表面上喊着同党中央保持一致、实际上没当回事，更不能违背中央大政方针各自为政、自行其是。党内组织和组织、组织和个人、同志和同志、集体领导和个人分工负责等重要关系都要按照民主集中制原则来设定和处理，不能缺位错位、本末倒置。党内政治生活和组织生活都要讲政治、讲原则、讲规矩，不能搞假大空，不能随意化、平淡化，更不能娱乐化、庸俗化。**党内上下关系、人际关系、工作氛围都要突出团结和谐、纯洁健康、弘扬正气，不允许搞团团伙伙、帮帮派派，不允许搞利益集团、进行利益交换**。

## Goods

A more general view beyond politics (just like neo-institutionalism over institutionalism)

Olson's Collective Action

Private: Software?  
Club: Water network?  
Common: Freshwater?  
Public: Dam?

## Collective Action Problem

Everyone has an intention **not** to contribute.

See also Garrett Hardin' s tragedy of the commons

a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.
