## Successful Ice Break

.pull-left[
### Basic structure

1. A question
1. How do you analyze
1. What do you find

]

.pull-right[
### About professional stuff

1. Professional section setting
1. Clear puzzle
1. Interesting solution/interpretation

A .red[punchline] at the beginning

## Underlying Logic

.pull-left[

*Emotion are .red[contagious]*

- Gestures
- Face expression
- Sound

]

???

- Fake smile: no eye area move
    - People see real happy face, they are more memorable; and vise versa (why you turn to forget in a big classroom)
- Different hellos lead to different type of impression: people like happier people


--

.pull-right[

*Verbal Triggers*

The brain looks for .red[hits] not misses

- What do you do?
- Where're you from?
- How're you?
- Been busy lately?

When asked "been busy lately," the brain will try to find hits of being busy---bad things---recently happened?

When asked "working on exciting things recently," the brain will look for good things 

- Create happiness: borrow the happiness from the past event to here
- Make you more memorable

*Practice*

```{r elevator30, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 0,
          seconds = 30,
          play_sound = TRUE)
```

1. Randomly pairing
1. 30 sec to capture the others attention
1. Repeat what you learned after a little while
