## Allias Paradox

???

By Maurice Allais, Nobel Prize in Economics in 1988

Experiment on real people: more people pick blue pile and yellow piles

People should consistently choose left or right strategy, rather than blue and yellow or red and green. 

The experiment shows most people choose blue plus yellow, indicating that people choose what to gain or loose right now, not on the final outcome, and certainty over risk.

## Heuristics and Bias (Tversky & Kahneman 1974)

.center[<img src = "../analysisOfPublicPolicy/images/rat_heuristic.jpg" height = 300 >]

> Whilst heuristics can speed up our problem-solving and decision-making processes, they can introduce errors and bias judgements.   
---Dale 2015


???

‰∏æ‰∏ç‰∏æÂæóËµ∑Êù•ÔºåÁî®ËÑöË∏¢


This article described three heuristics that are employed in making judgments under uncertainty: (i) representativeness, which is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event A belongs to class or process B; (ii) availability of instances or scenarios, which is often employed when people are asked to assess the frequency of a class or the plausibility of a particular development; and (iii) adjustment from an anchor, which is usually employed in numerical prediction when a relevant value is available. These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgments and decisions in situations of uncertainty.

.huge[

]

]

???

individuals disproportionately stick with the status quo, which is an important reference point

Loss aversion + Reference dependency

people make decisions based on the potential gain or losses relative to their specific situation (the reference point) rather than in absolute terms; this is referred to as reference dependence.

Faced with a risky choice leading to gains, individuals are risk-averse, preferring solutions that lead to a lower expected utility but with a higher certainty (concave value function).
Faced with a risky choice leading to losses, individuals are risk-seeking, preferring solutions that lead to a lower expected utility as long as it has the potential to avoid losses (convex value function).

# Criticism: Irrationality

## Irrational Models in General


Rationality is just a conjecture of economists.<sup>&midast;</sup>

## Agenda Setting

???

A collection of problems, understandings of causes, symbols, solutions, and other elements of public problems that come to the attention of members of the public and their governmental officials.

boundaries of the system agenda represents the limit of legitimate jurisdiction of existing governmental authority---changing over time

e.g., of the third face: Appalachian coal miners. The mining company remains dominant and the miners cannot conceive of a situation. When the miners show some signs of rebelling, the dominant interests are able to ignore pressure for change. In the long run, people may stop fighting as they become and remain alienated from politics; quiescence is the result.

Appealing to higher level

1. Going public with a problem by using symbols and images to induce greater media and public sympathy for their cause.

1. Groups that lose in the first stage of a political conflict appealing to higher decision-making level, such as when losing parties appeal to state and then federal institutions for an opportunity to be heard, hoping that in the process they will attract others who agree with them and their cause

This package of programs was made possible by an aggressively activist president and a large Democratic majority in the Congress
