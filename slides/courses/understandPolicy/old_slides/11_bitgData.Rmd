## What's Big Data?

What do you think? 

--

*Common definition*: 

> Big data usually includes data sets with sizes **beyond the ability of commonly used software tools** to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time.

--

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
Data sets characterized by huge amounts<sup>1</sup> of frequently updated<sup>2</sup> data in various formats<sup>3</sup>, such as numeric, textual, or images/videos.<sup>4</sup>  
]

--

.pull-left[
[1] **.red[V]olume**  
[2] **.red[V]elocity**  
[3] .red[V]ariety  
[4] Two more: veracity and value
]

???

veracity: the quality, accuracy, integrity (how do you know?)  
value: how much value for each unit of data?

1. Big enough
1. Created unintentionally

> ......I established a CPC elite database containing extensive biographical and career information for over 20,000 positions with a unique number of 4,700 cadres, including all the members of the Central Committee and Provincial Standing Committee of the CPC from 1982 to 2020......

> To provide a further test of the classic arguments on democracy and public support, we generated estimates of democratic support......assembling as much survey data on democratic support as possible. We employed 4,905 national opinions on democracy from 1,889 national surveys, representing a 32.0% and 37.3% increase respectively over the 3,716 opinions and 1,376 national surveys used in Claassen (2020a; 2020b).

## Problems of Big Data

1. Are you responsible for your data sources?
1. How "big" is big?
1. Anything new?
1. How do we understand?
1. What May Your Findings Affect

## Veracity Responsibility of Data

> In December 2014, anonymous blogger......released an archive of all 2013 and 2014 emails to, and some from, the account of the Internet Propaganda Office, a branch of the propaganda department......The emails reported activities of Internet commentators......from workers claiming credit for completing their assignments, and many other communications...The archive’s large size, complicated structure, numerous attachments, diverse document formats (screen shots, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, raw text, text as part of other emails, etc.), multiple email storage formats, and many links to outside information has made digesting much of it impossible either for individuals reading and coding by hand or for existing methods of automated text analysis.  --- King et al. 2017, p.487

Can *law of large number* and *central limit theorem* be applied to big-data analysis?

--

Not saying sampling bias, provenance conflicts, increased fluctuations,  error rates...
