???

1. One of the goals is to being competitive;
1. More sources in English;
1. Software in English
1. Zhuangbility: heteroscedasiticity, endogeneity, multicollinearity...

## Replication

Final task for this work. 

--

King, Gary. 1995. “Replication, Replication.” *PS: Political Science & Politics* 28(03): 444–52.

"The only way to understand and evaluate an empirical analysis filly is to know the exact process by which the data were generated and the analysis produced."

---

## Why Replication

It's responsibility;

--

It's a training;

--

It can be a contribution;

--

It'll be 40% of your grade~
