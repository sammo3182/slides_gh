# How to Conduct Good SNA

## Evaluating SNA

.pull-left[

~~Be objective~~

Reality is not universal;
Policy is constructed.

]

--

.pull-right[

~~Be voiceless~~

Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, gender is constructed.

One is not born a woman, but becomes one.

--

.pull-left[

~~Be experimental~~

The SNA assumes impacts and multicausality are data and useful.

]

--

.pull-right[
~~Be replicated~~

## Evaluation System

+ Credibility
+ Transferability
+ Dependability
+ Confirmability

### Credibility

If the data and implications are presented credibly.

Based on enough description and background

e.g. Censorship, social desirability

---

### Transferability

--

Readers' call, though.

### Dependability

Legit process of inquiry

+ What kinds of data, what period of time? 
+ Over a determined period of time, or simply one visit and a few interviews?  
...


???

Censorship

Authoritarianism, communist capitalism can be used to describe nowadays China?

---

### Confirmability

Findings clearly linked to analysis, data, and the research site.

???

There's an alternative set of criteria which is more philosophical,

## A Good ?-N Analysis

| Large-N           | Small-N           |
|---------------|---------------|
| Objective     | Understanding |
| Voiceless     | Voice         |
| Experimental  | Comparison    |
| Replicable    | Depth         |
| Generalizable | Context       |

Always care about the framing and understanding an issue from different angles.

???

+ Understanding: the researchers' background, view, approach, and value; 钟南山更可信
+ Voice: Study by Bourgois and Schonberg (2009) of homeless men and women who were addicted to drugs is compelling because it showed they care.
+ Comparison: reflexivity: Well-crafted studies provide the reader an opportunity to reflect on his or own situations in regard to similarities and differences.
+ Depth: richesness for understanding and context differences
+ Context: not only if policy works, but what cases not and why
