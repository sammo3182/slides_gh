A sociological approach

Dramaturgical analysis is a way of looking at our everyday life as if we were actors on a stage in a play. Imagine you're in a school play and you have different scenes where you act as different characters — maybe you're a student in one scene, a friend in another, or a sibling at home in another scene.

In each scene, you behave differently depending on who is watching you and what your role is. When you're with your teachers, you might act polite and focused. When you're with your friends, you might be more relaxed and playful. And at home, you might act a little differently around your family.

The idea comes from a famous thinker named Erving Goffman. He said that in everyday life, we are all like actors who wear different "masks" and perform different "parts" depending on who we're with and where we are. Just like in a play, we sometimes follow scripts — these are the things we say and do that are expected of us in different situations.

So, dramaturgical analysis is a way to understand how people interact with each other by comparing everyday life to being in a theater play, where we change our behavior based on our roles and the "audience" (or people) around us.

Dramaturgical analysis can be a very interesting way to explore political behaviors and events, as it helps us understand the roles politicians play, how they present themselves, and how they want to be seen by the public. Here are a couple of real-life examples illustrating how this approach can be used to analyze political science questions:

1. **Political Campaigns:**
   - **Situation:** During election campaigns, politicians often stage events, speeches, and debates.
   - **Analysis:** Each politician performs as if on stage, aiming to show their best qualities, win over the audience (voters), and convince them of their capability to lead. The way they dress, talk, and interact are all part of their "performance" to fit the role of a leader. They may change their tone or emphasis depending on whether they are speaking at a rally, a town hall, or in a televised debate. 

2. **Legislative Debates:**
   - **Situation:** Inside a legislative body, such as a parliament or congress, members debate and discuss various policies.
   - **Analysis:** Legislators act according to the "script" of their political party or their personal political beliefs. They perform roles that might include being a supporter, a critic, a mediator, or a rebel, depending on the audience and their objectives. Their performances are also for their constituents, ensuring they see their representative fighting for their interests. Legislators' actions are often tailored to how they will be perceived in the media and by the public.

3. **International Summits:**
   - **Situation:** World leaders meet at international summits to discuss global issues like climate change, trade, or security.
   - **Analysis:** Each leader is there not just as an individual but as a representative of their country. They perform roles that demonstrate their country’s stance and interests. In these settings, leaders are very conscious of the international audience and their domestic audience back home. They carefully choose their words, gestures, and interactions to align with the image and message they want to portray.

4. **Crisis Management:**
   - **Situation:** When handling crises, such as natural disasters, health emergencies (like a pandemic), or economic downturns, political leaders must address the public and manage the situation.
   - **Analysis:** Leaders often adopt a "commander-in-chief" or "guardian" role. They use specific language, attire, and settings that convey control, reassurance, and competence. Their public appearances and speeches are crafted to instill confidence and calm in the public, even if behind the scenes the situation might be chaotic.

These examples show how dramaturgical analysis can provide insights into not just what political figures do, but how and why they perform their roles in the way they do, considering the effect on their audience and their political objectives. This method highlights the theatrical nature of politics, where public perception is as crucial as actual policy-making.

+ Understanding: the researchers' background, view, approach, and value; 钟南山更可信
+ Voice: Study by Bourgois and Schonberg (2009) of homeless men and women who were addicted to drugs is compelling because it showed they care.
+ Comparison: reflexivity: Well-crafted studies provide the reader an opportunity to reflect on his or own situations in regard to similarities and differences.
+ Depth: richesness for understanding and context differences
+ Context: not only if policy works, but what cases not and why
