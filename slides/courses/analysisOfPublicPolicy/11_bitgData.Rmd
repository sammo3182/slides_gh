# "Big-Data" Analysis

## What's Big Data?

> Data sets characterized by huge amounts<sup>1</sup> of frequently updated<sup>2</sup> data in various formats<sup>3</sup>, such as numeric, textual, or images/videos.<sup>4</sup>  

--

[1] Volume  
[2] Velocity  
[3] Variety

[4] Two more "v"s: veracity and value

???

veracity: accuracy, integrity (how do you know?)  
value: how much value for each unit of data?

---

## Big Data for Policy Analysis

Volume : Probably more than Excel and SPSS can handle;  

--

Velocity : More relate to commercial, but also the information background setting of policy implementation;  

--

Variety : statistical techniques + social-science ideas

......

---

1. Initiation of the agenda
1. Profile of policy makers
1. Policy making process
1. Logic of policy decisions and implementation
1. Policy evaluation
1. Prediction of policy outcomes  
......

## Example: Relationship Analysis

Jiang, Junyan, Tianguang Meng, and Qing Zhang. 2019. “From Internet to Social Safety Net: The Policy Consequences of Online Participation in China.” *Governance* 32(3): 531–646.

1. 900,000 petitions
    + A substantial share of the LLMB (Local Leader Message Board) petitions concern personal problems that are most likely to be experienced by lower-class citizen.
    + A sizable share of the petitions are originated from rural and suburban areas


(pocketbook: individual economic sources)


2. 4,400 government reports at both the city and provincial levels between 2000 and 2014
    + cities that receive a larger number of online petitions in a year tend to devote significantly higher proportions of government reports in the following year to a topic on social welfare
    + policy effect appears to be mainly driven by petitions filed by rural residents concerning issues related to their pocketbook conditions.

## Issues about Big-Data Based Analysis

1. How "big" is big?
1. Anything new?
1. Where are they from?
1. How do we understand?
1. Is it morally correct?
