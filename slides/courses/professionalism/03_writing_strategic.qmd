# Writing a Paper <br> in a Week
Ref. @Carr2016

## When should you use it {.nonincremental}

- Goal
    - An [above-B+]{.red} paper for a course
    - A [qualified]{.red} piece in a good/professional shape

::: {.fragment}

- Before the week
    - Read the syllabus or whatever requirements
    - Finished the literature review (in person and/or with Large Language Models, LLMs)

:::

## D1~2: Framework

- Opening a new document in Word, or take a blank sheet
- Writing down the "creative" point(s) of the paper
    - A.k.a. the one or two sentences that you want the readers to get after reading the piece
- Writing the outline
    1. Figures and tables
    2. Basic frame

:::: {.columns .fragment}

::: {.column .nonincremental width="50%"}

+ Introduction
+ Literature Review\*
+ Theory
+ Method and Data

:::

::: {.column .nonincremental width="50%"}

+ Analysis and Results
+ Discussion and Conclusion
+ Reference [(leaving this to the bibliography manager)]{.fragment}

:::

::::

## D3~5: Drafting

1. Writing out the main points of each section
    - Bullet points
1. Finishing the "Method and Data" section
    + Setup the terminology
1. Finishing the "Analysis and Results" section
    + Setup the major findings
1. Finishing the "Conclusion" section
    + Summarize the findings
    + Talk to the (broad) literature
1. Finishing the "Introduction" section
1. Give a good title of the paper

## D6~7: Polising

1. Check for grammar, spelling, phrasing errors (w. LLMs)
    - English: Claude > ChatGPT > others
    - Chinese: Deepseek/Qwen > others
1. Remove LLM traces
1. Check the format of references

## How to write readable sentences

![@WilliamsBizup2014](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/ew_elementOfStyle.jpg){fig-align="center" height=600}

:::



## Clarity

- Make main characters subjects.
- Make important actions verbs
    + reduce nominalization of verbs.
- When to use nominalization:
    + As a short subject refers to a previous sentence
    + As a motivation ("the fact that" sb. does sth).
    + As the object of the verb
    + A concept so familiar to your readers

::: {.notes}

+ The nominalization as a short subject refers to a previous sentence (e.g., these arguments, this decision.)
+ The nominalization refers to "the fact that" sb. does sth.
+ A nominalization names what would be the OBJECT of the verb, the "what" or "whom" of the verb.
+ A nominalization refers to a concept so familiar to your readers that to them, it is a virtual character

:::

## Coherence

+ Underline the [first five or six words]{.red} in every sentence, and check if they constitute a relatively [small set]{.red} of related ideas and if they name the most important characters.
+ Use the [topic as the subject]{.red}, and put them at the beginning of the sentences.
+ [Don't vary]{.red} the subjects of the sentences frequently
+ Change a little only when the same words for the same topic were times used in the same positions of sentences.
+ [Don't overuse]{.red} "and, also, moreover, another, and so on", words that simply "Here's one more thing."
+ [Don't use]{.red} "but, however, therefore, or consequently" too frequently.


## Elegence

* Revise long sentence
    + Get to the subject of the main clause quickly
    + Get to the verb and object quickly
    + Avoid sprawls (which, that, who + is/was)
    + Drop "although" with a long clause
    + Drop "since" with a long clause
* Balance
    + with coordination (and, or, nor, but, and yet)
    + without coordination but with similarly structure in each clause.
* Climactic Emphasis: leave heavy words at the end
    + Heavy: n. > a./ad. > prep.

# Writing <br> a Publishable Paper 

Ref. @McEnerney2014

## Mindsets

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- You write to help think
 - *Don't wait until you are thinking everything through to start writing*
- A published paper needs "to be written (at least) [twice]{.red}"
    - You need to use two "languages" to write: 
        - a thinking language (for you) and a reading language (for readers)
- You need to have a sense of writing to whom before starting

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/ew_flow.png){.fragment fig-align="center" height=300}

- Your teachers do not always give the "right" comments and suggestions
    - Paid for reading
    - ~~Understand the world~~ [Evaluate you]{.red}

:::

::::

::: {.notes}

You create the text through the horizontal process, but it is the vertical process that decides whether it works.

1. Slowing down
1. reread over and over (only you have/are forced to read)
1. misunderstand
1. Stop

Never reach the understanding-the-world level: some instructors may say "no, students' work are amazing." Lier! You can asked them back: "do you publish them? how often do you read a student's paper when you don't have to"

:::

## What is worth to read

[Being [valuable]{.red} for the readers]{.fragment style="text-align:center; margin-top: 2em"}

- What's valuable
    - What do you do, when somebody says s/he doesn't understand you?
    - Why do you write for an academic paper? 
        - To convey your thoughts, to build up the knowledge?


::: {.notes}

When a PhD students come to my office, saying that this is important! I have to write about it!
What journal do you want to submit then? 
Why it matters?
It matters because value is the key! The readers are the key!
This is the problem caused by the examination in school: they do not teach you there are difference among readers

- What's valuable

Are you describing something ABOUT? 
Does your paper describe the "about"?
Is that what professional academic papers do? 
No, you may say, they are making arguments, are they different? 
No difference. 
The correct answer: is to tell YOU the question YOU have, and the solution

- What do you do, when somebody says s/he doesn't understand you?

You explain it...Don't do that
Because what you explain is to reveal what inside of your head---no one care what's in your head
Only teachers want to know what in your head: because they are paid for it

- to build up the knowledge

No, it is not.
it's to change your readers' ideas. "why should I think that"

:::


## The "right" goal to write {.Large .center background="#43464B"}


+ Help the [readers]{.red} to understand what they want to understand better.
+ To move the [conversation]{.red} forward




## Who Are the Readers?

> Nothing would be accepted to be knowledge until it is challenged [by who are competent to challenge]{.red}.

::: {.fragment style="text-align:center; margin-top: 1em"}

&dArr;

Peer-Review System

&dArr;

Readers who have the professional function to challenge 
a.k.a., editors and reviewers

:::

::: {.callout-warning .fragment style="text-align:center; margin-top: 1em"}

## Be aware

These readers [DON'T]{.red} trust you; they assume you are [WASTING]{.red} their time.

## Myth of value

- Original ~~is~~ valuable
    - New knowledge is pretty easy to create
- Knowledge ~~is~~ valuable

::: {.r-hstack .fragment}

:::

::: {.notes}

- New knowledge

how many people in this room? Nobody else in the world knows---but they don't care either.

- Knowledge

Ideally, knowledge is cumulative, the old stuff is always there like the left; but no, it is actually only a bunch of people deciding

In the western world, too male, too pale, too stale. (it's changing, way too long, way too small, way to slow, but changing; but except for that this is the real world)

The boundary of the knowledge is permeable (things coming in and out)

## Every community has its own codes

::::{.overlay-container}

::: {.overlay-text}

*Version A*:

> About democratic regimes and public support, there are two possible relationships. 
    One is that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong.
    The other is that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. 
    Some research find that countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. 
    The others found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

:::

::: {.overlay-text-over .fragment}

*Version B*: 

> It has long been argued that democratic regimes and public support for them are mutually reinforcing: 
    that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong, and that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. 
    But the evidence for either part of this claim has been decidedly mixed. 
    Countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. 
    Similarly, studies have alternately found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

## What make the paragraph sound valuable

It has [long]{.blue} been [argued]{.blue} that democratic regimes and public support for them are mutually reinforcing: that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong, and that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. [But]{.red} the [evidence]{.blue} for [either]{.red} part of this claim has been [decidedly]{.blue} [mixed]{.red}. Countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. [Similarly]{.red}, [studies]{.blue} have [alternately]{.red} found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or [instead]{.red} that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

[*Codes of instability*]{.red} 
[Codes of community]{.blue}

::: {.notes}

- Instability

Attention, challenge, contradiction, redflag

Not only grammarly flow/transition words but showing the tensions

- Community

"Making things organized"? No, showing there is a community. I have read your stuff, and I have something to say

Why saying some readers are wrong can get published? With the entering code: wow, you are smart, you are fabulous, you are contributive, but there is a little stuff 

Risky, though: Saying you are great, but I have something new---why should I care about you?

# How to read books {.appendix}

As a graduate-level reader (ref. @Christen2010)

## You should read

[*The more you read, the better you can write*]{style="text-align:center"}

- Knowing the literature
- Reading has stronger influence on writing than writing does on reading 
    - Reading something well before writing
- Impossible mission: reading everything word for word, line-by-line, taking diligent notes

## Plan your reading

1. Read the Table of Contents
    - To get a map and where you should stop. 
    - Learn (and write) descriptive chapter titles
2. Read the Index
    - Index sometimes works bettern than TOC or the introduction
    - It's more "objective"
    - Take a note of the subjects you should pay attention to

[Now you can make your reading plan: where to scan and where to scrutinize.]{.fragment}

## Reading the most important

1. Read the introduction
    - What to look for: 
        1. Primary thesis
        2. Sub arguments
    - Pay attention to the ["first-person"]{.red} pronouns.
2. Read each chapter
    - What to look for:  
        - The first few paragraphs/pages
        - Subheadings
        - The last few paragraphs/pages
        - If there are examples, read one or two to get a sense and skip the rest
    - Pay attention to the relations of them with the thesis

---

3. Read the conclusion [closely]{.red}
    - Review the links between the thesis and subarguments on your reading notes with that is described in the conclusion
        - If they have inconsistency, go back to the relevant chapters.
4. Final attention 
    - Footnotes/endnotes
        - Scanning for words or arguments related to your work
    - Bibliography
        - Old names, repeated names, good sources

## Wrap up

::: {.nonincremental}

- Reading is more important than you think
- You should have a reading plan
- Strategically allocate your time of reading
