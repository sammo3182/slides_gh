### How to Write a Paper that is Publishable

(Yeah, you can't write a publishable paper in a weekend. Get rid of the illusion!)

1. **What** and **why** you are doing wrong things in professional writings
1. Everything can get better/correct with a tiny yet crucial **mindset** changing
1. How to **practice** as a good expert writer


.footnote[The whole lecture is inspired by Pete Carr's video at ["Surviving and thriving in higher education"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY7sVKJPTMA&list=RDQMjS5obi2z3pQ&start_radio=1) at University of Minnesota and Larry McEnerney's lectures in the "Leadership Lab" at the University of Chicago.]

# Writing a Paper in a Weekend

---

class: large, center, middle 

What Paper You'll Get

An .red[above-B+] paper as a course assignment or conference paper

--

A .red[qualified] paper to show your competent to research

--

A paper for your teacher will   
.red[not hate] you

---

class: large, center, middle

## Preparation (BEFORE the Weekend)

Finishing Literature Review

--

Reading the syllabus    
.normal[(or wherever has the concrete requirements)]

--

That's it!

---

## Framing

Opening a new document in Word, or take a blank sheet

--

Writing down the "creative" point of the paper

--

Start writing the outline:

+ Figures and tables
+ Bullet points of each section
+ Basic frame
    + Introduction
    + Literature Review
    + Theory
    + Method and Data
    + Analysis and Results
    + Discussion and Conclusion
    + Reference

---

class: middle, center

*Finishing the "Method and Data" section*
+ Setup the terms and names

--

*Finishing the "Analysis and Results" section*
+ Setup the major findings

--

*Finishing the "Conclusion" section*
+ Why it's a done job
+ Using the bullet points or numbering, if necessary

--

*Finishing the "Introduction" section*
+ Showing the findings!

--

*Finishing the "Reference" section*
+ You shouldn't do that manually

---

class: large, center, middle

## Important Points

No procrastinate!

No editing and correcting!

No more readings!


---

## You Made It! 

Almost....

Please clean your language

Williams, Joseph, and Joseph Bizup. 2014. Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace. 5th edition. Boston: Pearson.

---

## Clarity

+ Make main characters subjects.

--

+ Make important actions verbs
    + reduce nominalization of verbs.
    
--

+ When to use nominalization:
    + As a short subject refers to a previous sentence
    + As a motivation ("the fact that" sb. does sth).
    + As the object of the verb
    + A concept so familiar to your readers

???

+ The nominalization as a short subject refers to a previous sentence (e.g., these arguments, this decision.)
+ The nominalization refers to "the fact that" sb. does sth.
+ A nominalization names what would be the OBJECT of the verb, the "what" or "whom" of the verb.
+ A nominalization refers to a concept so familiar to your readers that to them, it is a virtual character

---

## Coherence

+ Underline the .navy[first five or six words] in every sentence, and check if they constitute a relatively .navy[small set] of related ideas and if they name the most important characters.

--

+ Use the .navy[topic as the subject], and put them at the beginning of the sentences.

--

+ .red[Don't vary] the subjects of the sentences frequently

???

Change a little only when the same words for the same topic were times used in the same positions of sentences.

--

+ .red[Don't overuse] "and, also, moreover, another, and so on", words that simply "Here's one more thing."

--

+ .red[Don't use] "but, however, therefore, or consequently" too frequently.

---

## Elegence

* Revise long sentence
    + Get to the subject of the main clause quickly
    + Get to the verb and object quickly
    + Avoid sprawls (which, that, who + is/was)
    + Drop "although" with a long clause
    + Drop "since" with a long clause

--

* Balance
    + with coordination (and, or, nor, but, and yet)
    + without coordination but with similarly structure in each clause.

--

* Climactic Emphasis: leave heavy words at the end
    + Heavy: n. > a./ad. > prep.

# Writing a Paper that Is Publishable

---

## Two Approaches to Teach/Learn Writing

.pull-left[
*Bottom-up*

A.k.a., what we just discussed in the previous section

+ Rule-governing training
+ Low-value materials (memo, reports, slides)
+ High-school style: "Not start writing until thinking through"

]

.pull-right[
*Top-down*

+ For "expert writers"    
.small[Having expert knowledge in a certain area]
+ Writing to .red[help] thinking

<img src = "images/ew_sherlock.gif" >

]

???

Unlike journalists, you write to help thinking, rather than the other way around.

---

## "Rules" Are Less Universal

"Never write long sentences," your writing advisor said.

> With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. --- Abraham Lincoln (1865)

???

Why longer sentences could be useful: to not show the stress so intense (which would make everything look important---that is, unimportant.)

<img src = "images/ew_longerSentences.png">

Lincoln's Second inaugural address, long sentence so that the stress can be more power

(Is it a short sentence?)

> 在这个时候，我们提出划分敌我和人民内部两类矛盾的界限，提出正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，以便团结全国各族人民进行一场新的战争——向自然界开战，发展我们的经济，发展我们的文化，使全体人民比较顺利地走过目前的过渡时期，巩固我们的新制度，建设我们的新国家，就是十分必要的了。 --- 毛泽东（1957）

???

《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，在最高国务会议第十一次（扩大）会议上的讲话

现在的情况是:革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争基本结束，但是阶级斗争还没有完全结束；广大群众一面欢迎新制度，一面又还感到还不大习惯；政府工作人员经验也还不够丰富，对一些具体政策的问题，应当继续考察和探索。这就是说，我们的社会主义制度还需要有一个继续建立和巩固的过程，人民群众对于这个新制度还需要有一个习惯的过程，国家工作人员也需要一个学习和取得经验的过程。

The only universal rule is spelling

???

You create the text through the horizontal process, but it is the vertical process decides whether it works.


1. Slowing down
1. reread over and over (only you have/are forced to read)
1. misunderstand
1. Stop

---

even my teachers?

That's also why you have no clue how to handle the problem

???

Never reach the understanding-the-world level: some instructors may say "no, students' work are amazing." Lier! You can asked them back: "do you publish them? how often do you read a student's paper when you don't have to"

Valuable to the readers

When a PhD students come to my office, saying that this is important! I have to write about it!

What journal do you want to submit then? 

Why it matters?

It matters because value is the key! The readers are the key!

This is the problem caused by the examination in school: they do not teach you there are difference among readers

---

class: center, normal

## Idea Is Valuable

Why you write a paper?    
(Not an assignment)

???

Are you describing something ABOUT? 

Does your paper describe the "about"?

Is that what professional academic papers do? 

No, you may say, they are making arguments, are they different? 

No difference. 

The correct answer: is to tell YOU the question YOU have and solution

--

What you do, when somebody says     
s/he doesn't understand you?

???

You explain it...Don't do that

Because what you explain is to reveal what inside of your head---no one care what's in your head

Only teachers want to know what in your head: because they are paid for it

--

Why do you write?     
To convey your thought, to build up the knowledge.

--

No, it is not.

???

it's to change your readers' ideas. "why should I think that"

---

### True Goals

+ Helping .red[readers] to understand what they want to understand better.
+ To move the .red[conversation] forward

---

## Who Are the Readers?

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
Nothing would be accepted to be knowledge until it is challenged by who are competent to challenge.
]

.center[
&dArr;

Peer-Review System

&dArr;

Readers who has the professional function to challenge    
a.k.a., editors and reviewers
]

???

These readers don't trust you; they are assuming you are wasting their time.

(That's why when you point to someone where the library is, rarely they will say...I doubt about that)

---

class: normal, right

## Original Is Valuable

> You need to produce new/original/creative research.
> ---At least one of your professors

--

New knowledge is pretty easy to create

???

how many people in this room? Nobody else in the world knows---but they don't care either.

--

Valuable to your readers?

---

## What's Is Knowledge

.pull-left[
<img src = "images/ew_utopian.png" height = 400>
]

--

.pull-right[
<img src = "images/ew_elite.png" height = 400>
]

???

Ideally, knowledge is cumulative, the old stuff is always there like the left; but no, it is actually only a bunch of people deciding

In the western world, too male, too pale, too stale. (it's changing, way too long, way too small, way to slow, but changing; but except for that this is the real world)

The boundary of the knowledge is permeable (things coming in and out)

---

## Codes Making Things Important

**Version A**: About democratic regimes and public support, there are two possible relationships. One is that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong.
The other is that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. 
Some research find that countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. 
The others found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

--

**Version B**: It has long been argued that democratic regimes and public support for them are mutually reinforcing: that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong, and that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. But the evidence for either part of this claim has been decidedly mixed. Countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. Similarly, studies have alternately found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

## Writing with Codes

But, either, mixed, alternatively, instead, however, although, inconsistent, anomaly......

.red[Codes of instability]

???

Attention, challenge, contradiction, redflag

Not only grammarly flow/transition words, but showing the tensions

--

Long, argued, evidence, decidedly, studies, Widely, excepted, reported......

.navy[Codes of community]

???

"Making things organized"? No, showing there is a community. I have read your stuff, and I have something to say

Why saying some readers are wrong can get published? With the entering code: wow, you are smart, you are fabulous, you are contributive, but there is a little stuff 

Risky, though: Saying you are great, but I have something new---why should I care about you?

## Final Test

> The dog chased the cat.

> The cat was chased by the dog.

Which sentence is more concise?

???

It depends on the readers, depending on whether readers are caring more about the dog or the cat.

Concision is not how many words in a sentence but how much time a reader is going to process it to find the value.

How about the stress? Aren't stress is at the end? 

There are two parts of a sentences: the focus and the stress. 
The focus is the subject, for readers to the mind for you to judge whether it's about a thing you care. 
This is the prerequisite.
When you make the judgement, it is no longer matter. What impress you then is the stress part.
