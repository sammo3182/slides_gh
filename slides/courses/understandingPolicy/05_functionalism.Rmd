1. Reference style: .red[Author-Date] system of the .red[17th Edition] of the Chicago Manual of Style

Sociology: Emile [ei'mi:l] Durkheim [ˈdɜːkhaɪm], 涂尔干

In social sciences, functionalism is a theory based on the premise that all aspects of a society serve a purpose and that all are indispensable for the long-term survival of the society. The approach gained prominence in the works of 19th-century sociologists, particularly those who viewed societies as organisms1. 

In philosophy, functionalism in the philosophy of mind is the doctrine that what makes something a mental state of a particular type does not depend on its internal constitution, but rather on the way it functions, or the role it plays, in the system of which it is a part2. 

In architecture, functionalism is a style of architecture that emerged in the early 20th century, characterized by an emphasis on function and utility over ornamentation and aesthetics3.
