## A Typical PA Class

### GOAL

1. Policy .blue[whisperer]
1. .blue[Paradigm] of social science
1. .red[Academic] writing/presenting

---

## A .red["]Typical.red["] PA Class

* Little about policy process
* Little about statistics

--

* Primarily .red[perspectives and methods]
* .blue[Professional] training

---

class: small

## In a Conventional PA Class

* A lot of .red[concepts and procedures]
    + Structures/systems/branches/sections
    + Procedures/execution/communication
    + Outcomes
    + Evaluation/Issue    
    ......

--

* A lot of .red[models]
    + Smith Model
    + Mutual Adaptation Model
    + Communication Model of Intergovernmental Policy Implement   
    ......

--

* A lot of .red[specific] areas
    + Bureaucratic system
    + Social welfare
    + Environmental, distribution, tax, revenue    
    ......


---

## Why

> [A PA class is] a program that prepares individuals to .red[serve as managers] in the executive arm of local, state, and federal government and that focuses on the .red[systematic study] of executive organization and management.

> --- National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the US




???

Incorporate with organization theories, law management, bureaucrat, budget analyses, etc.

Why? 

General education class; not every manager knows the above to be the manager

## What I Want You to Learn

A story first

--

Long long time ago, like in 1927,...

.center[<img src="images/intro_TaftHutchins.png" height = 400 />]

???

William Howard Taft: The 27th president of the United States and the tenth chief justice of the United States

Robert Maynard Hutchins: Dean of Yale Law School (28 yr old), 后president of the U of Chicago

---

## Chief Justice vs. Chancellor of the School

1927, Yale

--

[Taft:] Well, I understand that at Yale you teach your students that judges are fools.

--

[Hutchins:] No, Mr. Chief Justice, at Yale we teach our students to .blue[find that out] for .red[themselves].
